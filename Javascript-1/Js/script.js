//As like other programming language, there are certain rules to declare variables in Js.
//1.We cannot use reserved words in Js or keywords of Js as a variable name.
//2.Variable should not start from any number. eg, 2num, 3name, #num,etc are not okay to declare variable.
//3.A variable name should start from any alphabet or _ or $. eg, num,_num,$num,etc here all three names are okay.
//4.Variable name should not contain any space. eg, num 1 is not okay, rather we can write num_1 or num1,etc.



//var,let and const are three ways of declaring variable in Js. However, once the value of variable is assigned using const, it can't be changed. But the value of variable can be changed if they are declared using let and var keyword. var was used before but now let and const are discovered to declare variables in Js.
