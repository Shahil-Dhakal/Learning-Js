    <p>Comparison operator in Js is used to compare variables to get the result.<br>
        for eg;<br>
        <span>a=b;</span> in js assigns value of b to a.<br>
        <span>a==b;</span> in js checks weather the value of a abd b are equal or not. double = do nnot check data type in js while comparing. for eg; 5=='5' will be a true conndition in js though one 5 is integer and other 5 inside quotation is a string.<br>
        Similarly, <span>a===b;</span> in js checks both the value and data type also. It only returns true if both data type and value of the variable are equal. for eg; 5===5; is true but 5==='5' in not true as one 5 is integer and other is a string.
    </p>
    <p style="color:red">
        Not equals to operator<br>
        <span>!=</span><br>
        for eg;<br>
        5!=10;<br>  <!-- ---------true.....It doesnt checks data type -->
        But,<br>
        5!==5   <!-- -----false. as 5 is equals to 5 and double = do compares data type too. -->
        <br>
        5!=='5' <!-- ---------true. as one 5 is int and other is string -->
    </p>
    <p>
        1.greater than operator.<br>
        2.less than operator.
    </p>
    <p><u><b>Logical operator</b></u></p>
    <p>&&-and</p>
    <p>||-or</p>
    <p>!-not operator. it changes the result from true to false and vice versa.</p>
